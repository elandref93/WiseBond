# Email Deliverability Guide for WiseBond

## Current Status
Your Mailgun integration is working correctly. To prevent emails from going to spam/junk folders, you need to implement the following DNS records and best practices.

## 1. DNS Records (Critical - Must Set Up)

### Add these DNS records to your `wisebond.co.za` domain:

**SPF Record (TXT)**
```
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all
```

**DKIM Record (TXT)**
```
Name: k1._domainkey
Value: [Get this from your Mailgun control panel under Domain Settings]
```

**DMARC Record (TXT)**
```
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@wisebond.co.za; ruf=mailto:dmarc@wisebond.co.za; fo=1
```

**MX Record (Optional but recommended)**
```
Name: @
Value: mxa.mailgun.org (Priority: 10)
Value: mxb.mailgun.org (Priority: 10)
```

## 2. Mailgun Configuration

### In your Mailgun Dashboard:
1. Go to Sending → Domains
