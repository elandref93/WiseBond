How to Access the SARB Prime Rate API
The South African Reserve Bank provides public API endpoints that you can use to access the current prime rate. Here's a simple explanation of how to use them:

Primary API Endpoint
https://custom.resbank.co.za/SarbWebApi/WebIndicators/HomePageRates
This endpoint returns a JSON array containing various financial rates including the prime lending rate. No authentication is required.

Alternative API Endpoint (Backup)
https://custom.resbank.co.za/SarbWebApi/WebIndicators/CurrentMarketRates/
This is an alternative endpoint that also provides the prime rate and can be used as a backup.

Example Response Format
Both endpoints return data in this format:

[
  {
    "Name": "Prime lending rate",
    "SectionId": "HPRINT",  
    "SectionName": "Interest rates",
    "TimeseriesCode": "MMRD000A",
    "Date": "2025-04-07",
    "Value": 11.0000,
    "UpDown": 0,
    "FormatNumber": "0.00",
    "FormatDate": "yyyy-MM-dd"
  },
  // Other rates...
]
How to Extract the Prime Rate
Make a GET request to the endpoint
Parse the JSON response
Find the object where "Name" equals "Prime lending rate"
The prime rate is stored in the "Value" field
Implementation Example (Python)
import requests
def get_prime_rate():
    endpoint = "https://custom.resbank.co.za/SarbWebApi/WebIndicators/HomePageRates"
    response = requests.get(endpoint, timeout=30)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        prime_rate_entry = next((entry for entry in data if entry.get("Name") == "Prime lending rate"), None)
        
        if prime_rate_entry:
            return {
                "prime_rate": prime_rate_entry.get("Value"),
                "effective_date": prime_rate_entry.get("Date"),
                "status": "success"
            }
    
    return {"error": "Unable to retrieve prime rate data"}
Notes for Developers
No API key is required
Include proper error handling in your code
Consider implementing a fallback mechanism using the alternative endpoint
Data is updated by SARB on business days
The information is available in the public domain for transparency purposes
