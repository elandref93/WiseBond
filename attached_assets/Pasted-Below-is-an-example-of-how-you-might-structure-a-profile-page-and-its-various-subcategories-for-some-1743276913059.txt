Validation:
Key fields (such as ID/Passport, date fields, or numerical fields for income/debt) should have validation to ensure correct data formats.

Uploads & Attachments:
Provide a secure way to upload PDF, JPG, or PNG documentation.
Examples: identity documents, payslips, bank statements, signed contracts.

Progress Tracking & Draft Saving:
Allow users to save partially completed profiles. They can log in later to finish or update their details.

Review & Submit Step:
A final step with a summary of all entered information, so the user can review and confirm accuracy before submitting.

By structuring your registration/profile form in these categories, you ensure that you collect all the necessary data for bond registration while maintaining clarity and a logical flow for the user. You can customize the above outline based on regional regulations (for example, certain countries may require additional tax or identification information).
