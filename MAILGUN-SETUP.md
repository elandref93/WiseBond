# Mailgun Setup Guide for WiseBond

This document explains how to set up and configure Mailgun for email functionality in the WiseBond application.

## Requirements

- A Mailgun account
- Domain verified with Mailgun
- API credentials

## Configuration Options

The application supports two methods for configuring Mailgun:

### 1. Environment Variables (.env file)

Add your Mailgun credentials to the `.env` file in the project root:

```
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-api-key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=sender@your-domain.com
```

### 2. Azure Key Vault (Recommended for Production)

For secure storage of credentials in production, the application can fetch secrets from Azure Key Vault:

1. Create an Azure Key Vault instance
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `MAILGUN-API-KEY`
   - `MAILGUN-DOMAIN`
   - `MAILGUN-FROM-EMAIL`
3. Configure Azure credentials in your environment

## Testing Email Functionality

You can test the email functionality using the `test-email.js` script:

```
node test-email.js
```

This will attempt to send a test email using the configured Mailgun credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Sandbox Domain Restrictions

If you're using a Mailgun sandbox domain, you can only send emails to authorized recipients. To add authorized recipients:

1. Log in to your Mailgun dashboard
2. Navigate to Sending â†’ Domains
3. Select your sandbox domain
4. Go to the "Authorized Recipients" section
5. Add the email addresses you want to send to

### API Key Issues

If you're experiencing authentication issues, verify your API key is correct and that you're using the Private API Key, not the Public API Key.

### DNS Configuration

For production domains, ensure all required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, etc.) are properly configured according to Mailgun's instructions.

## Email Templates

The application includes pre-built templates for:

- Calculation results emails
- Account verification emails

You can customize these templates in the `server/email.ts` file.
