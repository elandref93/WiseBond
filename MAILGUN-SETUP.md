# Mailgun Setup Guide for WiseBond

This document explains how to set up and configure Mailgun for email functionality in the WiseBond application.

## Requirements

- A Mailgun account
- Domain verified with Mailgun (wisebond.co.za)
- API credentials

## Configuration Method: Azure Key Vault

WiseBond uses Azure Key Vault exclusively for storing and retrieving sensitive credentials:

1. Create an Azure Key Vault instance named "wisebond"
2. Add the following secrets (using lowercase naming convention with hyphens):
   - `mailgun-api-key` - Your Mailgun Private API key
   - `mailgun-domain` - Your verified Mailgun domain (wisebond.co.za)
   - `mailgun-from-email` - Your sender email (postmaster@wisebond.co.za)
3. Configure Azure credentials in your environment (for local development only)

## Testing Email Functionality

You can test the email functionality using the provided test scripts:

1. Test Azure Key Vault secrets:
   ```
   node test-keyvault.js
   ```

2. Test Mailgun directly (uses Key Vault for credentials):
   ```
   node test-mailgun.js
   ```

3. Test the email functionality through the application:
   ```
   node test-email.js
   ```

These tests will verify your Azure Key Vault is properly configured and that emails can be sent using the retrieved credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Sandbox Domain Restrictions

If you're using a Mailgun sandbox domain, you can only send emails to authorized recipients. To add authorized recipients:

1. Log in to your Mailgun dashboard
2. Navigate to Sending â†’ Domains
3. Select your sandbox domain
4. Go to the "Authorized Recipients" section
5. Add the email addresses you want to send to

### API Key Issues

If you're experiencing authentication issues, verify your API key is correct and that you're using the Private API Key, not the Public API Key.

### DNS Configuration

For production domains, ensure all required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, etc.) are properly configured according to Mailgun's instructions.

## Email Templates

The application includes pre-built templates for:

- Calculation results emails
- Account verification emails

You can customize these templates in the `server/email.ts` file.
