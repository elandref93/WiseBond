# Mailgun Setup Guide for WiseBond

This document explains how to set up and configure Mailgun for email functionality in the WiseBond application.

## Requirements

- A Mailgun account
- Domain verified with Mailgun (wisebond.co.za)
- API credentials

## Configuration Methods

### Primary Method: Azure Key Vault (Production)

WiseBond uses Azure Key Vault as the primary method for storing and retrieving sensitive credentials:

1. Create an Azure Key Vault instance named "wisebond"
2. Add the following secrets (using lowercase naming convention with hyphens):
   - `mailgun-api-key` - Your Mailgun Private API key
   - `mailgun-domain` - Your verified Mailgun domain (wisebond.co.za)
   - `mailgun-from-email` - Your sender email (postmaster@wisebond.co.za)
3. Configure Azure credentials in your environment (for local development only)

### Alternative Method: Replit Secrets (Development)

For development environments like Replit where Azure Key Vault may not be accessible, you can use Replit's built-in secrets management:

1. In your Replit project, go to "Secrets" in the Tools sidebar
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `MAILGUN_API_KEY` - Your Mailgun Private API key
   - `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` - Your verified Mailgun domain (wisebond.co.za) 
   - `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL` - Your sender email (postmaster@wisebond.co.za)

The application will automatically use these secrets if Azure Key Vault is not available.

## Testing Email Functionality

You can test the email functionality using the provided test scripts:

1. Test Azure Key Vault secrets:
   ```
   node test-keyvault.js
   ```

2. Test Mailgun directly (uses Key Vault for credentials):
   ```
   node test-mailgun.js
   ```

3. Test the email functionality through the application:
   ```
   node test-email.js
   ```

These tests will verify your Azure Key Vault is properly configured and that emails can be sent using the retrieved credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Sandbox Domain Restrictions

If you're using a Mailgun sandbox domain, you can only send emails to authorized recipients. To add authorized recipients:

1. Log in to your Mailgun dashboard
2. Navigate to Sending â†’ Domains
3. Select your sandbox domain
4. Go to the "Authorized Recipients" section
5. Add the email addresses you want to send to

### API Key Issues

If you're experiencing authentication issues, verify your API key is correct and that you're using the Private API Key, not the Public API Key.

### DNS Configuration

For production domains, ensure all required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, etc.) are properly configured according to Mailgun's instructions.

## Email Templates

The application includes pre-built templates for:

- Calculation results emails
- Account verification emails

You can customize these templates in the `server/email.ts` file.

## Secret Naming Conventions

It's important to follow consistent naming conventions for secrets across different environments:

| Purpose | Azure Key Vault | Replit/Environment Variables |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Mailgun API Key | `mailgun-api-key` | `MAILGUN_API_KEY` |
| Mailgun Domain | `mailgun-domain` | `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` |
| Mailgun From Email | `mailgun-from-email` | `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL` |
| Google Maps API Key | `google-maps-api-key` | `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` / `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` |
| SendGrid API Key | `sendgrid-api-key` | `SENDGRID_API_KEY` |

The application automatically converts between these formats as needed.
